# Default config for tofi
#
# Copy this file to ~/.config/tofi/config and get customising!
#
# A complete reference of available options can be found in `man 5 tofi`.

#
### Fonts
#
	# Font to use, either a path to a font file or a name.
	#
	# If a path is given, tofi will startup much quicker, but any
	# characters not in the chosen font will fail to render.
	#
	# Otherwise, fonts are interpreted in Pango format.
	font = "Sans"

	# Point size of text.
	font-size = 24

	# Perform font hinting. Only applies when a path to a font has been
	# specified via `font`. Disabling font hinting speeds up text
	# rendering appreciably, but will likely look poor at small font pixel
	# sizes.
	hint-font = true

#
### Colors
#
	# Window background
	background-color = #1B1D1E

	# Border outlines
	outline-color = #080800

	# Border
	border-color = #F92672

	# Default text
	text-color = #FFFFFF

	# Selection text
	selection-color = #F92672

	# Selection background
	selection-background = #00000000

#
### Text layout
#
	# Prompt to display.
	prompt-text = "run: "

	# Maximum number of results to display.
	# If 0, tofi will draw as many results as it can fit in the window.
	num-results = 0

	# Spacing between results in pixels. Can be negative.
	result-spacing = 0

	# List results horizontally.
	horizontal = false

	# Minimum width of input in horizontal mode.
	min-input-width = 0

#
### Window layout
#
	# Width and height of the window. Can be pixels or a percentage.
	width = 1280
	height = 720

	# Width of the border outlines in pixels.
	outline-width = 4

	# Width of the border in pixels.
	border-width = 12

	# Radius of window corners in pixels.
	corner-radius = 0

	# Padding between borders and text. Can be pixels or a percentage.
	padding-top = 0
	padding-bottom = 0
	padding-left = 0
	padding-right = 0

#
### Window positioning
#
	# Location on screen to anchor the window to.
	#
	# Supported values: top-left, top, top-right, right, bottom-right,
	# bottom, bottom-left, left, center.
	anchor = center

	# Window offset from edge of screen. Only has an effect when anchored
	# to the relevant edge. Can be pixels or a percentage.
	margin-top = 0
	margin-bottom = 0
	margin-left = 0
	margin-right = 0

#
### Behaviour
#
	# Hide the cursor.
	hide-cursor = false

	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
	# Otherwise, just print the command line to stdout.
	drun-launch = false

	# If true, print an executable command line for the selected
	# application when in drun mode. Otherwise, just print the path of the
	# .desktop file.
	#
	# *WARNING*: This currently defaults to false. In the next version of
	# tofi, this will change to always be true, as it should have been from
	# the start.
	drun-print-exec = true
