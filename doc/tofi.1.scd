# NAME

tofi - Tiny dynamic menu for Wayland, inspired by *rofi*(1) and *dmenu*(1).

# SYNOPSIS

*tofi* [options...]

*tofi-run* [options...]

*tofi-drun* [options...]

# DESCRIPTION

*tofi* is a tiny dynamic menu for Wayland compositors supporting the
layer-shell protocol. It reads newline-separated items from stdin, and displays
a graphical selection menu. When a selection is made, it is printed to stdout.

When invoked via the name *tofi-run*, *tofi* will not accept items on stdin,
instead presenting a list of executables in the user's $PATH.

When invoked via the name *tofi-drun*, *tofi* will not accept items on stdin,
and will generate a list of applications from desktop files as described in the
Desktop Entry Specification.

*WARNING*: In the last version of tofi, when a selection was made in drun
mode, the filename of the selected desktop file was printed to stdout. In the
current version of tofi, this has changed to an executable command line, to be
passed to swaymsg exec or similar. Consequently, the --drun-print-exec does
nothing, and may be removed in a future version of tofi.
