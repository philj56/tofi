# NAME

tofi - Tiny dynamic menu for Wayland, inspired by *rofi*(1) and *dmenu*(1).

# SYNOPSIS

*tofi* [options...]

*tofi-run* [options...]

*tofi-drun* [options...]

# DESCRIPTION

*tofi* is a tiny dynamic menu for Wayland compositors supporting the
layer-shell protocol. It reads newline-separated items from stdin, and displays
a graphical selection menu. When a selection is made, it is printed to stdout.

When invoked via the name *tofi-run*, *tofi* will not accept items on stdin,
instead presenting a list of executables in the user's $PATH.

When invoked via the name *tofi-drun*, *tofi* will not accept items on stdin,
and will generate a list of applications from desktop files as described in the
Desktop Entry Specification.
